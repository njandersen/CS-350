_**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving**_

The project was designed to prototype a smart home thermostat. It has a set point that once it gets to it will turn off. It also has two buttons on each side that allows you to increase or decrease the set point for the temperature. 

_**What did you do particularly well?**_

I feel that the state machine is something that I struggled with at first but have done really well on in this project. Especially the logic for the on and off function of the thermostat. 

_**Where could you improve?**_

The biggest thing for me is not really one aspect of the project, its more of getting a better understanding overall. I understood enough to complete the assignment but I want to learn the ins and outs of these systems. I feel like if I would have dedicated more time to that the project would have been even better 

_**What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?**_

I feel that everything I have learned in this class is a new tool. I knew nothing of embedded systems before this class, now I have a desire to build more embedded systems. Forums still remain a great place to get answers for the questions that come up while coding. 

_**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?**_

State machines seem like they would be a good resource to have the knowhow to implement. Along with knowing how embedded systems work overall. 

_**How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**_

By making sure to comment the code when I could and laying out everything in a manner in which anyone could pick it up and see what is going on with little effort.
